## Hi there, I'm Fernanda (she/her) ðŸ‘‹


I am curently a sophomore in college from Long Beach, California interested in software devleopment and cybersecurity!

My passion from STEM originates from time in the engineering pathway at my high school where I took various engineering classes, 
including Principles of Engineering, Introduction to Aerospace Engineering from the Project Lead The Way curriculum.

I took Introduction to Computer Science: C++ and Introduction to Java. 

Some of my projects that you can find on here include:

* Software that finds the compounding periods from user input.
* Software that finds compounding periods from a file input.
* Program that can find which countries produced the most products using arrays.
* Program that creates a rocketship using loops.

Outside of coding,

I participate in a youth organization from the Youth Leadership Institute where we advocate for a smoke free Long Beach and create 
multimedia projects to support the cause. As a member, we manage a social media account on Instagram where we post educational information about the effects of smoking.
